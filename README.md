# LeisureLink 

## Get Started

use `git clone https://github.com/dwu101/LeisureLink.git` to clone this repo 

download node from https://nodejs.org/en if you haven't already 

download PostgreSQL from https://www.postgresql.org/download/ if you haven't already 

download Postman if you haven't already to test API endpoints

## How to run:

You must have 2 terminals on whatever ide you use. Assuming you use vscode, there is a + button on the very right side of the terminal. 


In one terminal, cd into the backend folder and execute `pip install -r requirements.txt`, which will download all the necessary packages (if this doesn't work, you'll have to manually install packages that can't import when you start the app). Then execute `python app.py`. This will run on http://127.0.0.1:5000

In the other terminal, cd into the frontend folder and execute `npm install`, which will download all the necessary packages (if this doesn't work, you'll have to manually install packages that can't import when you render a certain page) then execute `npm start`. This will open a page on http://localhost:3000/.
